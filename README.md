# hubot-xwiki

This bot is an experimental Hubot script allowing to connect hubot with XWiki

The following parameters are needed:

env.XWIKI_USERNAME=xwikiuser
env.XWIKI_PASSWORD=xwikipassword

It will allow to search XWiki using the "xsearch" command.
This script allows an XWiki application to callback hubot (the app is not yet released)
